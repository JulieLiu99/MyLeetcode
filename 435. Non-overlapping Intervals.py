        A classic greedy case: interval scheduling problem.
        
        1) always pick the interval with the earliest end time [implemented]
        2) or, always pick the interval with the latest start time
        
        --> the maximal capacity to hold rest intervals
        
        E.g. Suppose current earliest end time of the rest intervals is x. Then available time slot left for other intervals is [x:]. If we choose another interval with end time y, then available time slot would be [y:]. Since x â‰¤ y, there is no way [y:] can hold more intervals then [x:]. Thus, the heuristic holds.
